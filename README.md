# Project Details
### Problem Statement

Consider a well-established company operating in the retail food sector. Presently they have around several hundred thousands of registered customers and serve almost one million consumers a year. They sell products from 5 major categories: wines, rare meat products, exotic fruits, specially prepared fish and sweet products. These can further be divided into gold and regular products. The customers can order and acquire products through 3 sales channels: physical stores, catalogs and company’s website. Globally, the company had solid revenues and a healthy bottom line in the past 3 years, but the profit growth perspectives for the next 3 years are not promising... For this reason, several strategic initiatives are being considered to invert this situation. One is to improve the performance of marketing activities, with a special focus on marketing campaigns.

### Goals

Key Objectives are:
- Explore the data – be creative and pay attention to the details. You need to provide the marketing team a better understanding of the characteristic features of respondents;
- Propose and describe a customer segmentation based on customers behaviors;
- Create a predictive model which allows the company to maximize the profit of the next marketing campaign.
